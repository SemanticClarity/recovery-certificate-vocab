The terms and definitions used in this vocab were in part inspired by the recent publication from the [EU on the eHealth Networks guidelines on 
COVID-19 citizen recovery interoperable certificate - minimum dataset](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/preparedness_response/docs/covid-19_rat_common-list_en.pdf). This specification is designed to facilitate mapping of jurisdictional requirements, especially as it 
relates to different FHIR Profiles especially WHO IPS (International Patient Summary).
